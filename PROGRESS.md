# PROGRESS.md

## Split Status

The `ModernClawBase` split is in progress and not complete.

The repo already presents as a focused single-workspace product, but the finished base edition is not ready yet.

## Completed So Far

- removed the multi-workspace selector and related create/delete flows from the live app
- simplified app initialization around one durable workspace
- flattened the Brain suggestion store to one workspace
- completed the latest manual `tauri:dev` QA phase across the current product surface
- validated the Curator request-to-stage-to-import loop end to end
- documented the external Cowork Curator automation setup so the scheduled task can be rebuilt from the repo
- rewrote visible product copy around `workspace` instead of role-management language
- updated root docs to the ModernClawBase identity
- removed stale planning and summary docs that no longer matched the product

## Locked Decisions

- the split work so far has primarily removed the multi-Brain aspects of the app
- curator remains part of the currently shipped product during the transition
- curator is not required to define the finished `ModernClawBase` product
- curator is intended to complete the fuller multi product once the base edition is ready
- documentation should describe transition state honestly until the split is finished

## Current Transition State

The current shipped app still includes:
- one local workspace
- chat with conversation history
- editable `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `MEMORY.md`
- daily logs
- flat knowledge-file loading
- Brain suggestions and guided setup
- curator staging and import flow
- local Piper output and Whisper input
- onboarding, settings, and storage visibility

This means the fuller product shape is still more complete than the unfinished base edition.

## Current Execution Focus

The next split work is no longer testing.

The main remaining base/full seam is the hidden compatibility-friendly agent layer that still owns model and voice behavior behind the single-workspace UI.

## Verified

Verified in this workspace:
- `npm run build` succeeds in [local-ai](C:\Users\pento\Desktop\ModernClawBase\local-ai)
- `cargo check` succeeds in [src-tauri](C:\Users\pento\Desktop\ModernClawBase\local-ai\src-tauri)
- `npm run tauri:dev` launches and remains resident long enough to hold the Vite dev port and run `local-ai.exe`
- the live source no longer contains the removed multi-workspace UI/state hooks
- Curator automation can process a request and produce a staged package
- ModernClaw can display and import a staged Curator package when it is placed in the active workspace path

Current build notes:
- Vite reports a large frontend bundle warning
- Rust still has a few existing dead-code warnings
- the current Curator integration still depends on active-workspace path alignment between automation and app runtime

## Remaining To Reach Base Ready

1. Audit the app for remaining compatibility-only UI, state, and terminology after the completed QA pass.
2. Collapse or hide the internal compatibility-friendly agent layer where it still controls single-workspace model and voice behavior.
3. Decide what minimum compatibility scaffolding must remain in the base repo for migration safety.
4. Decide whether Curator automation should keep following active agent workspaces or be simplified into one clearer base-workspace path.
5. Define the base-ready milestone that separates transitional shipped scope from finished base scope.
6. Move curator out of the base definition once the base-ready milestone is reached.
7. Tidy remaining docs so they match the in-progress split state and then the final base state.

## Open Questions

- whether the internal compatibility-friendly agent layer should stay hidden, be simplified into workspace settings, or be removed from base entirely
- whether the current Brain naming and positioning is final for the base edition
- what exact milestone marks base-ready and triggers the curator handoff to the fuller multi product

## Working Rule

Keep this file short, current, and execution-focused.

If it stops reflecting the real split state, update it immediately.
